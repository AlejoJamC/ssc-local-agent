## 1. What type of coffee do you sell?
We specialize exclusively in **green (unroasted) coffee beans**, sourced directly from independent farmers in the Santander region of Colombia. Our focus is on exotic, heirloom, and high-quality micro-lot varieties.

## 2. Can I buy roasted coffee from Red and Green Forest Coffee?
While we specialize in **green coffee beans** for roasters and businesses, we also offer **roasted coffee** upon special request. Roasting is available under demand for an **additional fee**, allowing you to experience the full flavor potential of our beans before making larger green coffee purchases.

## 3. Where does your coffee come from?
All of our coffees are sourced from the **Santander region** of Colombia. We work directly with small-scale, independent growers, ensuring traceability and authentic origin flavors.

## 4. What makes Santander, Colombia coffee unique?
Santander's distinctive microclimates, high elevations (1,200-2,000 meters), and rich volcanic soils create ideal growing conditions for exceptional coffee. The region experiences consistent rainfall patterns and temperature variations that contribute to the development of complex flavor profiles. Additionally, many farms in Santander maintain heirloom and exotic coffee varieties that are increasingly rare in commercial production, resulting in truly unique taste experiences.

## 5. What makes your green coffee different from other suppliers?
Our direct-trade approach allows us to select **only the highest quality beans** at their peak ripeness. We prioritize sustainability, transparency, and ethical sourcing — no middlemen involved. Our coffee is sourced exclusively from small farms in Colombia's Santander region, known for its exotic heirloom varieties and rich biodiversity.

## 6. How do you ensure the quality of your green coffee beans?
We work closely with farmers during harvesting and processing stages. Every batch we import is **cupped**, **graded**, and **traced** back to the farm level. Only beans scoring above a certain quality threshold make it into our catalog. We employ a rigorous multi-stage evaluation process, including professional cupping using SCA protocols, with minimum score requirements of 85+ points for our standard offerings and 87+ for our premium selections.

## 7. Are your coffee beans organic or sustainably farmed?
While not every farm we work with is certified organic, all our partners practice **sustainable, environmentally conscious farming methods**. Many of our partner farms follow organic practices but may not hold formal certification due to the cost barriers for small producers. We prioritize actual sustainable practices over certifications alone.

## 8. How do you ensure ethical sourcing and fair compensation for farmers?
We negotiate directly with farmers, paying above-market prices to support sustainable practices. Our pricing model starts with the cost of production, adds a significant quality premium, and ensures sustainable profitability for farmers. We commit to multi-year purchasing agreements with our partners to provide income stability and enable long-term farm investments.

Sample costs are credited toward your first full order.

## 11. What is the minimum order quantity (MOQ)?
For roasters and businesses, our standard minimum order is one bag (approximately 70kg/154lbs).
